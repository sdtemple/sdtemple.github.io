title:  'Statistical Genetics 2: Genome-wide Association Studies'
---

<h1>Genome-wide Association Studies</h1>
<br/>
Prerequisites: STAT 340/1/2, or basics of linear modeling (regression analysis) <br/><br/>
Description: We will build working knowledge about statistical genetics, linear modeling, and hypothesis testing to better understand 
the landmark papers Yu et al. (2006) and Klein et al. (2005). These papers introduce genome-wide association testing, a methodological
paradigm that has led to the discovery of thousands of associations between gene markers and traits. In surveying these advances, we
will learn about the theory of linear models, mixed models, principal components, multiple testing, and permutation testing. 
One meeting will concern the difference between causation and association, especially considering statistical genetics long coupled 
history with eugenics. The final project will involve conducting a genome-wide association study using the publicly available 
1000 Genomes database. References may include Professor Timothy Thornton’s <a href = "http://faculty.washington.edu/tathornt/SISG2020.html">lecture slides</a> and 
“Overview of Statistical Methods for Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)” from 
Genome-Wide Association Studies and Genomic Prediction (2013). <br/><br/>

This site contains assigned readings and exercises. Accompanying videos, scripts, and data files will be shared with
mentees through Dropbox. Readings and exercises are to be done the week of and discussed in the following week. 
Some assignments will be formally submitted to Canvas for course credit.<br/><br/>
