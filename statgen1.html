title:  'Statistical Genetics 1: Pedigrees and Relatedness'
---

<h1>Pedigrees and Relatedness</h1>
<br/>
Prerequisites: STAT 311; some programming experience preferred <br/><br/>
Description: We will explore statistical theory and methodology as it applies to the study of (human) heredity. 
The overarching theme of the readings are 
(1) to compute measures of relatedness (kinship and inbreeding) and conditional trait (disease) risk based on known family trees and 
(2) to estimate relatedness given dense SNP or entire genome sequence data. 
Readings will follow UW emeritus professor Elizabeth Thompson’s monograph “Statistical Inference from Genetic on Pedigrees” (<a href = "files/rachel-slides.pdf">SIGDP</a>). 
We will cover conditional probabilities, likelihood models, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, 
the expectation-maximization algorithm to infer allele frequencies for the ABO blood group, Wright’s path counting formula, 
and identity by descent. During meetings we will work through practice exercises; for 1 or 2 meetings we will go through 
brief hands-on labs using current research software. The final project may involve estimating familial relationships among 
individuals in the 1000 Genomes database and comparing outputs among statistical software. <br/><br/>

This site contains assigned readings and exercises. Accompanying videos, scripts, and data files will be shared with
mentees through Dropbox. Readings and exercises are to be done the week of and discussed in the following week. 
Some assignments will be formally submitted to Canvas for course credit.<br/><br/>
