  <p class="lead">
  I am a PhD student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Washington and an NIH Predoctoral Trainee in Statistical Genetics. 
    My research interests concern statistical methodology with applications to genome sciences and public health.
    Currently, I am working on Identity By Descent (IBD) methods as a member of the <a href = "https://sites.uw.edu/sguy/">Browning Lab</a>.
    During Summer 2020, I developed Bayesian occupancy models for viruses in mosquito populations at Los Alamos National Laboratory.<br/>
<br/>
Before coming to UW, I provided actuarial services to Liberty Mutual.
    I majored in mathematics and minored in computer and information sciences at University of Oregon.
