  <h2 class="featurette-heading">About </h2>
  <p class="lead">
I am a senior PhD student in the <a href = "https://stat.uw.edu/about-us/people/seth-temple">Department of Statistics</a> at University of Washington, advised by <a href = "https://sites.uw.edu/sguy/">Sharon R. Browning</a> in our sister Department of Biostatistics. 
I develop statistical methods that make use of genomic and health data to infer 
key parameters that govern biological processes such as evolution and pathogen spread. 
I seek simple, interpretable, and approximate models that unify genetics, environment, ecology, 
and demography under a common quantitative framework for which we can evaluate uncertainty and 
test sensitivity to assumptions. Specifically, I am interested in what genomics can say about 
recent time periods (past 300 generations / 10k human years) and in studying 
underrepresented populations that carry a disproportionate disease burden. I maintain 
collaborations with Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at UW. 
My work is supported by an <a href = "https://ndseg.org/2021-fellows">NDSEG Fellowship</a> and an NIH T32 Predoctoral Traineeship in Statistical Genetics. 
I have professional experience as an actuary at Liberty Mutual and a BS in Mathematics from University of Oregon.
