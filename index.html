  <p class="lead" style="font-size: 24px">

I am a postdoctoral research fellow at University of Michigan - Ann Arbor. 
My primary project is to develop a foundation model for bioacoustics, especially for sparse classification of species. 
I am also studying statistical estimators for infection rates and a central limit theorem in population genetics.
Overall, I develop statistical methods that make use of biological and environmental data to study spatial and evolutionary processes.
I strive for reproducible experiments, well-documented software, efficient computation, and interpretable modeling.

<br/>
<br/>
I am currently working with Professors Jonathan Terhorst and Gideon Bradburd, funded by the Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellowship.
I completed a PhD degree in Statistics at University of Washington - Seattle, advised by Professors Sharon Browning and Elizabeth Thompson. 
There I pioneered several methods to study recent natural selection and spearheaded multiple consortium data analyses. 
I earned a BS degree in Mathematics (summa cum laude) at University of Oregon.
