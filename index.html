  <h2 class="featurette-heading">About </h2>
  <p class="lead" style="font-size: 24px">
I am a Schmidt AI in Science post-doctoral research fellow at University of Michigan - Ann Arbor. I am working with Professors Jonathan Terhorst and Gideon Bradburd.
<br/>
I completed a PhD in Statistics at University of Washington - Seattle. I was advised by Professors Sharon Browning and Elizabeth Thompson. I earned a BS in Mathematics (summa cum laude) at University of Oregon
<br/>
I develop statistical methods that make use of genomic and health data to study evolutionary processes.
I am passionate about solving hard data problems in creative ways. 
I strive for reproducible experiments, well-documented software, efficient computation, and interpretable modeling.
