  <p class="lead">
  I am a PhD student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Washington and an NIH Predoctoral Trainee in Statistical Genetics. 
    My research interests concern statistical methodology with applications to genome sciences and public health.
    Currently, I am studying Identity By Descent (IBD) methods for population genetics as a member of the <a href = "https://sites.uw.edu/sguy/">Browning Lab</a>.
    During Summer 2020, I developed Bayesian occupancy models for viruses in mosquito populations at Los Alamos National Laboratory.<br/>
<br/>
Before coming to UW, I worked as an actuarial student at Liberty Mutual.
    As an undergraduate, I majored in math and minored in computer science at University of Oregon.
