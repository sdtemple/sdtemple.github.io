  <h2 class="featurette-heading">About </h2>
  <p class="lead">
  I am a PhD student in the Department of Statistics 
    at the University of Washington. I am interested in modeling biological systems as stochastic processes.
    This interest motivates my participation in the <a href = "https://sites.uw.edu/sguy/">Browning Lab</a>, in the UW Statistical Genetics Seminar, and in the Summer Institute in Statistical Genetics. 
    For Summer 2020, I am building Bayesian dynamic occupancy models for viruses in mosquito populations at Los Alamos National Laboratory.<br/>
<br/>
Before coming to UW, I provided 
    actuarial services to Liberty Mutual.
    I completed my undergraduate studies at University of Oregon 
    where I majored in mathematics and 
    minored in computer and information sciences.
