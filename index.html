  <p class="lead">
    I am a PhD student in the <a href = "https://stat.uw.edu/about-us/people/seth-temple">Department of Statistics</a> at University of Washington. 
    Advised by <a href = "https://sites.uw.edu/sguy/">Sharon Browning</a>, I study statistical methods that make use of genomic correlation structure induced by recombination events. 
    More generally, I am interested in developing computationally efficient statistical methods inspired by biological processes. 
    I have contributed to the Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Sequencing Project at UW and directed research on mosquito vectors at Los Alamos National Laboratory. 
    My research is supported by an <a href = "https://ndseg.sysplus.com/">NDSEG Fellowship</a> and an NIH Predoctoral Traineeship in Statistical Genetics.
<br/>
<br/>
Before coming to UW, I worked as an actuarial student at Liberty Mutual, and I received a BS in Mathematics at University of Oregon.
